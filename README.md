# capsules-network
A simple Tensorflow implementation of capsules network with dynamic routing (Sabour, Frosst, and Hinton, 2017). Mostly for my personal learning. Please see my blog entry on capsules [here](https://leiz86.github.io/jekyll/update/2017/11/22/capsules.html).

I am indebted to the excellent Tensorflow implementations [here](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow) and [here](https://github.com/InnerPeace-Wu/CapsNet-tensorflow) as reference in this work.
